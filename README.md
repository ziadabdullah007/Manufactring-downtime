# Manufactring-downtime
The goal of this project is to analyze downtime occurrences in the manufacturing process, identify root causes, and provide actionable insights to minimize production interruptions. By leveraging historical data, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, we aim to improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and reduce lost production time.
